CERN (and not only).

If you'd like to devote a couple of years to working in our lab, you have an opportunity.

The gap between what people want and what science can achieve.

AI-driven laboratories:
how do we make a research process more automatic?

Self-running labs (mostly for drive discovery): <...>

If you know what is the property of the material you want to
