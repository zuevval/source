% This script is written and read by pdetool and should NOT be edited.
% There are two recommended alternatives:
 % 1) Export the required variables from pdetool and create a MATLAB script
 %    to perform operations on these.
 % 2) Define the problem completely using a MATLAB script. See
 %    http://www.mathworks.com/help/pde/examples/index.html for examples
 %    of this approach.
